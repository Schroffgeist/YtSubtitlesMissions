**MEXICO ACHIEVES HISTORIC POVERTY REDUCTION AMIDST GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECALIBRATION**

Mexico reports a significant reduction in poverty, with 13 million citizens exiting poverty during the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Data from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) indicates this achievement is primarily attributed to increased wages, challenging long-standing neoliberal economic doctrines that posited wage hikes would lead to economic instability. This development positions Mexico as a notable case study in poverty alleviation, though it remains distinct from Brazil's 25 million and China's hundreds of millions over decades.

**NEOLIBERALISM UNDER SCRUTINY**

The Mexican economic model, described as humanistic and welfare-oriented, operates independently of traditional international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Critics within Mexico argue that the success in poverty reduction directly contradicts the neoliberal framework, which they contend has historically favored elites and exacerbated wealth concentration. For context, analysis of the United States economy reveals that the wealthiest 1% of households control 42% of the nation's total wealth, while the remaining population holds a significantly smaller share. This disparity underscores a broader critique of "cannibal capitalism," a system where wealth accumulates in a limited number of hands. Proponents of the Mexican model advocate for a cultural shift towards empathy and solidarity, suggesting that a mere 2% contribution from the world's wealthiest individuals could address numerous global social challenges.

**NORTH AMERICAN ECONOMIC REALIGNMENTS**

In a notable shift in North American economic dynamics, Canada is actively seeking closer trade relations with Mexico. The Premier of Alberta, Canada, recently visited Mexico to discuss increased cooperation in natural gas and oil sectors. This overture follows Canada's previous stance advocating for Mexico's exclusion from the USMCA trade agreement, citing concerns over the influx of Chinese products through Mexico. The current Canadian initiative is reportedly driven by a desire to reduce economic dependence on the United States, particularly in light of recent economic pressures and job losses within Canada. Discussions include the potential development of a "Northern Belt," a commercial route between Mexico and Canada designed to bypass the United States, potentially integrating with China's "New Silk Road" initiative. Mexico views this renewed Canadian interest as a strategic advantage, offering a less contentious economic partnership compared to its often-strained relationship with the United States.

**GLOBAL FINANCIAL FLOWS AND WEALTH DISPARITY**

A detailed analysis of global financial movements highlights significant, often overlooked, cross-border capital flows. The United States continues to experience a substantial current account deficit, primarily driven by its trade deficit and, notably, by secondary income outflows. Secondary income, defined as unrequited transfers including remittances and government aid, has emerged as a critical factor. From 1999 to 2024, a cumulative 1.1 trillion US dollars in personal remittances departed the United States, with only 150 million US dollars entering the country. In 2024 alone, 72 billion US dollars in remittances left the United States. This outflow is equivalent to the market capitalization of major global corporations and, hypothetically, could finance the construction of 81 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.

These substantial secondary income outflows are reported to largely offset the United States' services surplus, a component often highlighted in economic reports. The expanding current account deficit, exacerbated by these transfers, is identified as a contributing factor to asset bubbles, housing unaffordability, and the widening gap in wealth inequality. Economic analysts suggest that addressing the current account deficit, including the significant secondary income component, should be a bipartisan priority to mitigate these systemic economic challenges.
